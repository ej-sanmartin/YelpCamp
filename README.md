=======================

Description
-----------------------

A project completed during Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy Course.

This project is a web application with sign up and login/ logoff features that also implement authorization and authentication. All of the pages on this site are dynamically created and the content consists of posts created by the user, geared towards describing a campsite through text and an image. There is, also, a comments functionality to each post!

This project is a full stack, web application, and I was able to learn and use many front end and backend technologies. Bootstrap and SemanticUI were some of the technologies used to style the front end. The entire application uses the Express.JS framework and RESTful routing to create structure. And, for the backend, Node.JS is used and Mongodb is implemented to store and retrieve data inputted by users.

This project gave me the valuable experience of creating a web app and to think my way through both the front end and the back end of a product.

A few features I would want to implement to better this project are allowing the user to upload photos not through a link but by uploading the picture themselves, dynamic prices for all the posts, and SEO.
